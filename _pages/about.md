I'm a 4th year PhD student studying Human Centered Design and Engineering ([HCDE](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/)) at the University of Washington advised by Sean Munson.

I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona in 2020, where I got my BS in Computer Science and minor in Psychology. During my time there I worked with Dr. Ben Stiechen in the Personalized Information Interaction research lab (HAPII) to develop and study novel search systems that can support users who have multiple language abilities.

Outside of school, I enjoy reading, painting, swimming, and spending time outdoors.
